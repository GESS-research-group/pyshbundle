#The purpose of this script is to,
#    firstly read what the data source is (JPL, CSR or ITSG)
#    read file path for GRACE L2 spherical harmonics inputs,
#    read replacement files for tn13 and tn14
#    source of the SH files (JPL, ITSG or CSR)
# The code returns path of data files, path of tn13 and path of tn14 replacement files
