"""The purpose of this script is to,
    load longterm mean for our GRACE SH data

    For this, we need to input the GRACE data source as well as the path to the longterm mean values
    Data source may be CSR, JPL or ITSG.

    For RL06, example data have been provided within the package. In case this option is chosen, the program directly returns the longterm mean values.

    Returns the long_mean path
