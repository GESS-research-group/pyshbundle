# PySHbundle: A Python implementation of MATLAB codes SHbundle <br>

PySHBundle is the python implementation of the popular SHBundle toolbox originally written using MATLAB. 

TODO: Badges and and banner for the project


## Usage

1. Read and Load level-2 spherical harmonic data
2. create basin time series for TWS
3. perform grace data driven correction

## 1. How to install <br>
### 1.1 For Users
Currently the package is not yet finalized hence the version on PyPI is outdated and should not be used. Please follow the steps mentioned for contributors in order to use the latest features. <br>

### 1.2 For Contributors
1. Fork the repository and clone it onto your system
2. In order to use the codebase understand the repository structure
   
   ```
   Example base repo path -> ../open-source/pyshbundle

   pyshbundle (base repo)
    | - pyshbundle (actual module)
        | - all the codes
    | - notebooks
    | - docs
    | - and rest other folders
   ```
3. in order to use any of the functions change the current directory to teh pyshbundle (base repo) then use import
   ```{python}
   import os

   os.chdir(../open-source/pyshbundle)

   import pyshbundle
   ```
