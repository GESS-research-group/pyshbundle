# PySHbundle: A Python implementation of GRACE Spherical Harmonics Synthesis MATLAB codes SHbundle <br>

![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=mn5hk.mat2py) <br>


PySHBundle is a tool to process GRACE L2 data. It includes python re-implementation of the popular [SHBundle](https://www.gis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/downloads/shbundle/) and [DataDrivenCorrection Bundle](https://www.gis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/downloads/datadrivencorrectionbundle/) tools originally written using MATLAB. 


## Usage

1. Read and Load level-2 spherical harmonic data
2. Create basin time series for TWS
3. Perform grace data driven correction
4. Plot spherical harmonic related plots

## 1. How to install <br>
### 1.1 For Users
The module can be installed via pip python package manager. Follow the follwing steps to setup a virtual environment and start exploring the GRACE Gravity Field data.

```shell
# creating a new virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv <name-env>
# activate the virtual environment environment
$ source </location-of-virt-env/name-env/bin/activate>
# install package into virtual environment
$ pip install pyshbundle

# clone the repository in order to access the notebooks and data
$ git clone https://github.com/mn5hk/pyshbundle.git
```

### 1.2 For Devs/Contributors
Developers can access the latest development branch and 
```shell
# clone the repo and fetch the dev branch
$ git clone https://github.com/mn5hk/pyshbundle.git

# creating a new virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv <name-env>

# install the dependencies from the requirements-dev file
$ pip install -r ../pyshbundle/requirements-dev.txt

# activate the virtual environment environment
$ source </location-of-virt-env/name-env/bin/activate>

# install package into virtual environment
$ pip install ../pyshbundle/dist/<required-version>.tzr.gz

# you also have the option to build the module using, be careful of 
$ python setup.py sdist
```

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

pyshbundle could always use more documentation,
whether as part of the official pyshbundle docs,
in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mn5hk/pyshbundle/issues)

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
