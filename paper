## Introduction


### General introduction to GRACE - Walling (under construction) 

GRACE stands for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, a joint satellite mission by NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and DLR, the German Aerospace Center. Basic stats: (do I need to add reference links?)

| Parameter        |    Answer      | 
| -------------    |:--------------:| 
| Start of Mission | 17 March 2002  | 
| End of Mission   | 27 October 2017| 
| Inclination      | 89.0Â°          | 
| Period           | 94.5 minutes   |  

The operating principle is as follows: 
GRACE has a successor, GRACE-FO, which was successfully launched on 22 May 2018.

### Spherical Harmonic Analysis (Vivek)

## The Inspiration

### Why do we need this software? <br>

This software makes the spherical harmonic analysis of GRACE data Open source since it is written in Python. This package has been based off of [insert MATLAB package]

## How to use the software?   <br>

[Amin and Vivek can answer this better I guess]


<ul>
<li>Audience </li> - Geodesists interested in quantifying mass loss 
<li>What are the entry points into the software?</li> - 
<li>How to preprocess data?</li> - Gaussian filtering comes here? 
<li>What all functionalities?</li>
<li>Some example codes</li>
</ul>
