# gaussian(L, cap): The program delivers the spherical harmonic coefficients of a gaussian
# smoothing filter. The coefficients are calculates according to Wahr et.
# al. (1998) equation (34) and Swenson and Wahr equation (34)

# How:      Wl = gaussian(L,cap)

# Input:    L    integer    maximum degree
#          cap  integer    half width of Gaussian smoothing function [km]
# Output:   Wl   [L+1 x 1]  smoothing coefficients
