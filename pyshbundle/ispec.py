% ISPEC(A,B) returns the function F from the spectra A and B.
%
%IN:
%    a ...... cosine coefficients 
%    b ...... sine coefficients          
%             
%             a and b are defined by:
%             f(t) = a_0 + SUM_(i=1)^n2 a_i*cos(iwt) + b_i*sin(iwt)
%   
%             with w = ground-frequency and n2 half the number of samples (+1).
%             Note that no factor 2 appears in front of the sum.
% 
% OUT:
%    F = ISPEC(A,B) considers A the cosine- and B the sine-spectrum.
%    F = ISPEC(S) assumes S = [A B].
%    If  A and B are matrices, Fourier operations are columnwise.
