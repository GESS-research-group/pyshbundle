# ispec(a,b) returns the function F from the spectra A and B.

#IN:
#    a ...... cosine coefficients 
#    b ...... sine coefficients          
             
#             a and b are defined by:
#             f(t) = a_0 + SUM_(i=1)^n2 a_i*cos(iwt) + b_i*sin(iwt)
   
#             with w = ground-frequency and n2 half the number of samples (+1).
#             Note that no factor 2 appears in front of the sum.
 
# OUT:
#    f = ispec(a,b) considers A the cosine- and B the sine-spectrum.
#    f = ispec(S) assumes S = [a b].
#    If  a and b are matrices, Fourier operations are columnwise.
