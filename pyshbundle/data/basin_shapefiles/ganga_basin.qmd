  <title>HydroBASINS Asia, Level 4, Version 1.c - Sub-basins in standard format (without lakes)</title>
  <abstract>All HydroBASINS layers were derived from World Wildlife Fund’s HydroSHEDS data based on a grid resolution of 15 arc-seconds (approximately 500 m at the equator). Watersheds were delineated in a consistent manner at different scales, and a hierarchical sub-basin breakdown was created following the topological concept of the Pfafstetter coding system. The resulting polygon layers are termed HydroBASINS and represent a subset of the HydroSHEDS database. This shapefile contains (sub-)basin polygons for Asia at Pfafstetter level 4.

HydroBASINS data provides a series of polygon layers that depict watershed boundaries and sub-basin delineations at a global scale. The goal of this product is to provide a seamless global coverage of consistently sized and hierarchically nested sub-basins at different scales (from tens to millions of square kilometers), supported by a coding scheme that allows for analysis of watershed topology such as up- and downstream connectivity.</abstract>
